5 years at CodeWorldwide. 
Is it a short or a long period...?

It was not that easy journey for me. After a small company where I became a programer, CodeWorldwide and Ciklum were really a shock. Huge amount of technologies, projects, people and bearded [Valentin](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007618276016). Craziness.

But with the lapse of time the сraziness was transformed into passion, passion to build good apps.

## Technologies
I was a witness of transition from slow classic web forms to fast single page apps. Tons of technologies were battle tested then: asp.net web forms, telerik, wcf, silverlight, f**king sharepoint. And now new technologies are becoming standard for us such as: cqrs, event sourcing, microservices, web.api, mongodb, single page app, even linux.

## Projects
I was a witness of transformation of our visual design from ugly, awkward windows form-like to a beautiful and user friendly one. Brand new animations, shapes, colors gave fantastic user experience. Pioneer of this transformation was PHD Source, just after it OMD Vision and finally Adzu 4 family. Due to CQRS and event sourcing approach server side performance was improved a lot, but with maintenance complexity side effect.

## People 
I was a witness of excellent creativity and performance of our team. We are not afraid of learning, learning, learning… As a result now we can cover mobile, server and web stack. 

QAs were the ones who prevented us from (*чик-чик и в продакшн*) fuckups. Managers were the ones who isolated us from full of useless non technical flows (*гавнища*). I liked it so much.

## Me
CodeWorldwide gaves me a huge amount of challenges, without them I wouldn't be who I am. [More then 10 speeches](http://slides.com/vgman/). Innumerous complex UI screens and animations. Brain blowing while event driven and microservices approach was applied. Unexpected drop live database. Restore after failed deploy. 

In non-working time. I managed to build [brand new house](http://gaevoy.github.io/my-timeline/building.html?bg). Two lovely children were born. 

So 5 years -  is it a short or a long period… It is a lot (*дохуя*).

Now I’m going to continue battle test technologies as a freelancer.
